# Godot 4.0 Raycast Issue

Demonstrates an issue with Godot 4.0 RayCast3D's 'target_position` not returning a correct position.

# Setup instructions

* Load the RayCast40 project in Godot 4 Beta 1 and hit play. The mesh should appear at the end of the ray but doesn't.
* Load the RayCast35 project in Godot 3.5 and hit play. The mesh appears correctly at the end of the ray with the same code and scene setup.
